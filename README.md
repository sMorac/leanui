# LeanUI
A lightweight, responsive and modular UI framework.

## The Grid 

This component is based on a 12 column grid but is completly configurable. 
You can add or remove almost any feature like responsiveness and offset if you want to get a thinner CSS stylesheet.

## Typography

LeanUI includes a set of headings and paragraph with basic spacing. You can also activate a mode for smaller typography, suitable for smaller screens.

## Navigation

LeanUI includes also a navbar and sidebar, that can be set to fixed and set on left, right (for sidebar) and top, bottom (for navbar). These can also include a navbar button list with active and hover positions.
